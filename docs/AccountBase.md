# AccountBase

A single account at a financial institution.
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**account_id** | **str** | Plaidâ€™s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can&#39;t reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new &#x60;account_id&#x60; will be assigned to the account.  The &#x60;account_id&#x60; can also change if the &#x60;access_token&#x60; is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that &#x60;access_token&#x60; are used to generate a new &#x60;access_token&#x60; on a later date. In that case, the new &#x60;account_id&#x60; will be different from the old &#x60;account_id&#x60;.  Like all Plaid identifiers, the &#x60;account_id&#x60; is case sensitive. | 
**balances** | [**AccountBalance**](AccountBalance.md) |  | 
**name** | **str** | The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself | 
**type** | [**AccountType**](AccountType.md) |  | 
**subtype** | [**AccountSubtype**](AccountSubtype.md) |  | 
**mask** | **str, none_type** | The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of an account&#39;s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item&#39;s accounts, and it may also not match the mask that the bank displays to the user. | [optional] 
**official_name** | **str, none_type** | The official name of the account as given by the financial institution | [optional]

Returned for Auth Items only.  &#x60;pending_automatic_verification&#x60;: The Item is pending automatic verification  &#x60;pending_manual_verification&#x60;: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification.

Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.  &#x60;verification_failed&#x60;: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.    | [optional]
