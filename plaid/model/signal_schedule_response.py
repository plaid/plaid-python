        Args:
            optimal_date (date, none_type): The recommended optimal date to submit the debit entry, formatted in ISO 8601 \"YYYY-MM-DD\" (e.g., \"2024-03-30\"). The `optimal_date` is derived from the date with rank = 1 in the following recommendations array.  NOTE: The `default_payment_method` field specified in the request will affect the recommendation, since we're accounting for debit settlement time.  The debit scheduling evaluation starts from the day the /signal/schedule request is submitted (Day 0) or the next banking day if the submission day is not a banking day, and extends through the following five banking days (Day 1 to Day 5). If no date within this period is considered likely to result in a successful debit attempt, `null` will be returned for the `optimal_date`.
            recommendations ([SignalScheduleRecommendation]): This array provides a date-by-date evaluation of debit submission recommendations within the five banking day evaluation period. Each object in the array represents a retry recommendation for a specific date.
            warnings ([SignalWarning]): If bank information was not available to be used in the Signal model, this array contains warnings describing why bank data is missing. If you want to receive an API error instead of Signal scores in the case of missing bank data, file a support ticket or contact your Plaid account manager.
            request_id (str): A unique identifier for the request, which can be used for troubleshooting. This identifier, like all Plaid identifiers, is case sensitive.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)

                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
