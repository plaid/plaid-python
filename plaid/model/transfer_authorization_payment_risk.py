        Args:
            bank_initiated_return_score (int, none_type): A score from 1-99 that indicates the transaction return risk: a higher risk score suggests a higher return likelihood.  The score evaluates the transaction return risk because an account is overdrawn or because an ineligible account is used and covers return codes: \"R01\", \"R02\", \"R03\", \"R04\", \"R06\", \"R08\",  \"R09\", \"R13\", \"R16\", \"R17\", \"R20\", \"R23\". These returns have a turnaround time of 2 banking days.
            customer_initiated_return_score (int, none_type): A score from 1-99 that indicates the transaction return risk: a higher risk score suggests a higher return likelihood.  The score evaluates the transaction return risk of an unauthorized debit and covers return codes: \"R05\", \"R07\", \"R10\", \"R11\", \"R29\". These returns typically have a return time frame of up to 60 calendar days. During this period, the customer of financial institutions can dispute a transaction as unauthorized.
            risk_level (TransferAuthorizationRiskLevel):
            warnings ([SignalWarning]): If bank information was not available to be used in the Signal model, this array contains warnings describing why bank data is missing. If you want to receive an API error instead of Signal scores in the case of missing bank data, file a support ticket or contact your Plaid account manager.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types

                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response

                                False if the variable names in the input data

                                classes that we have traveled through so that
