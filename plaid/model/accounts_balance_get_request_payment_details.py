                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal

For example, if the `amount` is 200 and the `balance_threshold_percentage` is 90, then the account balance must be at least 180 for `exceeds_balance_threshold` to be false.   By default, the available balance will be used for this calculation; if it cannot be obtained, the current balance will be used.   This field is particularly useful for customers using indirect Items and who do not have direct access to raw balance data.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of 90  # noqa: E501
            requires_real_time_balance_refresh (bool): A boolean that determines whether the balance has to be refreshed in real time as part of the API call when using Balance Plus. Setting this to field to `true` will result in more recent balances, but latency may be up to 30 seconds or more. If making a regular (non-Balance Plus) Balance call, without the `payment_details` object present, `/accounts/balance/get` will always return real-time balances..
