        Args:
            account_id (str): The ID of the account in which this transaction occurred.
            amount (float): The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. For all products except Income: Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative. For Income endpoints, values are positive when representing income.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
            date (date): For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ). To receive information about the date that a posted transaction was initiated, see the `authorized_date` field.
            pending (bool): When `true`, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
            transaction_id (str): The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.

                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)

                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its

            category ([str], none_type): A hierarchical array of the categories to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  All Transactions implementations are recommended to use the new `personal_finance_category` instead of `category`, as it provides greater accuracy and more meaningful categorization.

            location (Location): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            name (str): The merchant name or transaction description.   Note: This is a legacy field that is not actively maintained. Use `merchant_name` instead for the merchant name.  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            merchant_name (str, none_type): The merchant name, as enriched by Plaid from the `name` field. This is typically a more human-readable version of the merchant counterparty in the transaction. For some bank transactions (such as checks or account transfers) where there is no meaningful merchant name, this value will be `null`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            original_description (str, none_type): The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will be omitted unless the client has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            payment_meta (PaymentMeta): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            pending_transaction_id (str, none_type): The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            account_owner (str, none_type): The name of the account owner. This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            transaction_type (str): Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            logo_url (str, none_type): The URL of a logo associated with this transaction, if available. The logo will always be 100×100 pixel PNG file.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

            category ([str], none_type): A hierarchical array of the categories to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  All Transactions implementations are recommended to use the new `personal_finance_category` instead of `category`, as it provides greater accuracy and more meaningful categorization.  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            category_id (str, none_type): The ID of the category to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).

            name (str): The merchant name or transaction description.   Note: This is a legacy field that is not actively maintained. Use `merchant_name` instead for the merchant name.  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            merchant_name (str, none_type): The merchant name, as enriched by Plaid from the `name` field. This is typically a more human-readable version of the merchant counterparty in the transaction. For some bank transactions (such as checks or account transfers) where there is no meaningful merchant name, this value will be `null`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            original_description (str, none_type): The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will be omitted unless the client has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`..

            pending_transaction_id (str, none_type): The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

            transaction_type (str): Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            logo_url (str, none_type): The URL of a logo associated with this transaction, if available. The logo will always be 100×100 pixel PNG file.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
