                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
