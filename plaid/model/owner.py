        Args:
            names ([str]): A list of names associated with the account by the financial institution. These should always be the names of individuals, even for business accounts. If the name of a business is reported, please contact Plaid Support.  In the case of a joint account, the names of all account holders will be reported.  If an Item contains multiple accounts with different owner names, some institutions will report all names associated with the Item in each account's `names` array.
            phone_numbers ([PhoneNumber]): A list of phone numbers associated with the account by the financial institution. May be an empty array if no relevant information is returned from the financial institution.
            emails ([Email]): A list of email addresses associated with the account by the financial institution. May be an empty array if no relevant information is returned from the financial institution.
            addresses ([Address]): Data about the various addresses associated with the account by the financial institution. May be an empty array if no relevant information is returned from the financial institution.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response

                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data

                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
