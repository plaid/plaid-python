            transactions_update_status (TransactionsUpdateStatus):
            account (AccountBase):
            added ([Transaction]): Transactions that have been added to the Item since `cursor` ordered by ascending last modified time.
            modified ([Transaction]): Transactions that have been modified on the Item since `cursor` ordered by ascending last modified time.
            removed ([RemovedTransaction]): Transactions that have been removed from the Item since `cursor` ordered by ascending last modified time.
            next_cursor (str): Cursor used for fetching any future updates after the latest update provided in this response. The cursor obtained after all pages have been pulled (indicated by `has_more` being `false`) will be valid for at least 1 year. This cursor should be persisted for later calls. If transactions are not yet available, this will be an empty string.
            has_more (bool): Represents if more than requested count of transaction updates exist. If true, the additional updates can be fetched by making an additional request with `cursor` set to `next_cursor`. If `has_more` is true, itâ€™s important to pull all available pages, to make it less likely for underlying data changes to conflict with pagination.
            request_id (str): A unique identifier for the request, which can be used for troubleshooting. This identifier, like all Plaid identifiers, is case sensitive.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
