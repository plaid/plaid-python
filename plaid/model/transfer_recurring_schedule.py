        Args:
            interval_unit (TransferScheduleIntervalUnit):
            interval_count (int): The number of recurring `interval_units` between originations. The recurring interval (before holiday adjustment) is calculated by multiplying `interval_unit` and `interval_count`. For example, to schedule a recurring transfer which originates once every two weeks, set `interval_unit` = `week` and `interval_count` = 2.
            interval_execution_day (int): The day of the interval on which to schedule the transfer.  If the `interval_unit` is `week`, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer from 1 (Monday) to 5 (Friday).  If the `interval_unit` is `month`, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer indicating which day of the month to make the transfer on. Integers from 1 to 28 can be used to make a transfer on that day of the month. Negative integers from -1 to -5 can be used to make a transfer relative to the end of the month. To make a transfer on the last day of the month, use -1; to make the transfer on the second-to-last day, use -2, and so on.  The transfer will be originated on the next available banking day if the designated day is a non banking day.
            start_date (date): A date in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). The recurring transfer will begin on the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the `start_date`.  If the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the start date is also the same day that `/transfer/recurring/create` was called, the bank *may* make the first payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response

                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data

                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.

                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
