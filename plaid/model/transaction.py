        """Transaction - a model defined in OpenAPI

        Args:
            pending_transaction_id (str, none_type): The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable.
            category_id (str, none_type): The ID of the category to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            category ([str], none_type): A hierarchical array of the categories to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            location (Location):
            payment_meta (PaymentMeta):
            account_owner (str, none_type): The name of the account owner. This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts.
            name (str): The merchant name or transaction description.  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            account_id (str): The ID of the account in which this transaction occurred.
            amount (float): The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the account's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
            date (date): For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ).
            pending (bool): When `true`, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled.
            transaction_id (str): The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.
            payment_channel (str): The channel used to make a payment. `online:` transactions that took place online.  `in store:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `other:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  This field replaces the `transaction_type` field. 
            authorized_date (date, none_type): The date that the transaction was authorized. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ). The `authorized_date` field uses machine learning to determine a transaction date for transactions where the `date_transacted` is not available. If the `date_transacted` field is present and not `null`, the `authorized_date` field will have the same value as the `date_transacted` field.
            authorized_datetime (datetime, none_type): Date and time when a transaction was authorized in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ).  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00).
            datetime (datetime, none_type): Date and time when a transaction was posted in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ).  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00).
            transaction_code (TransactionCode):

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
                                _visited_composed_classes = (Animal,)
            transaction_type (str): Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            original_description (str, none_type): The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/get`, this field is in beta and will be omitted unless the client is both enrolled in the closed beta program and has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
