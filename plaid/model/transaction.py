        """Transaction - a model defined in OpenAPI

        Keyword Args:
            account_id (str): The ID of the account in which this transaction occurred.
            amount (float): The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. For all products except Income: Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative. For Income endpoints, values are positive when representing income.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
            category ([str], none_type): A hierarchical array of the categories to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  All Transactions implementations are recommended to use the new `personal_finance_category` instead of `category`, as it provides greater accuracy and more meaningful categorization.  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            category_id (str, none_type): The ID of the category to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  All Transactions implementations are recommended to use the new `personal_finance_category` instead of `category`, as it provides greater accuracy and more meaningful categorization.  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            date (date): For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ). To receive information about the date that a posted transaction was initiated, see the `authorized_date` field.
            location (Location):
            name (str): The merchant name or transaction description.   Note: This is a legacy field that is not actively maintained. Use `merchant_name` instead for the merchant name.  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            payment_meta (PaymentMeta):
            pending (bool): When `true`, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
            pending_transaction_id (str, none_type): The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
            account_owner (str, none_type): The name of the account owner. This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts.
            transaction_id (str): The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.
            authorized_date (date, none_type): The date that the transaction was authorized. For posted transactions, the `date` field will indicate the posted date, but `authorized_date` will indicate the day the transaction was authorized by the financial institution. If presenting transactions to the user in a UI, the `authorized_date`, when available, is generally preferable to use over the `date` field for posted transactions, as it will generally represent the date the user actually made the transaction. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ).
            authorized_datetime (datetime, none_type): Date and time when a transaction was authorized in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ). For posted transactions, the `datetime` field will indicate the posted date, but `authorized_datetime` will indicate the day the transaction was authorized by the financial institution. If presenting transactions to the user in a UI, the `authorized_datetime`, when available, is generally preferable to use over the `datetime` field for posted transactions, as it will generally represent the date the user actually made the transaction.  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00). This field is only populated in API version 2019-05-29 and later.
            datetime (datetime, none_type): Date and time when a transaction was posted in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ). For the date that the transaction was initiated, rather than posted, see the `authorized_datetime` field.  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00). This field is only populated in API version 2019-05-29 and later.
            payment_channel (str): The channel used to make a payment. `online:` transactions that took place online.  `in store:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `other:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  This field replaces the `transaction_type` field. 
            transaction_code (TransactionCode):
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
                                _visited_composed_classes = (Animal,)
            check_number (str, none_type): The check number of the transaction. This field is only populated for check transactions.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            merchant_name (str, none_type): The merchant name, as enriched by Plaid from the `name` field. This is typically a more human-readable version of the merchant counterparty in the transaction. For some bank transactions (such as checks or account transfers) where there is no meaningful merchant name, this value will be `null`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            original_description (str, none_type): The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will be omitted unless the client has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            transaction_type (str): Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            logo_url (str, none_type): The URL of a logo associated with this transaction, if available. The logo will always be 100×100 pixel PNG file.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            website (str, none_type): The website associated with this transaction, if available.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

            personal_finance_category_icon_url (str): The URL of an icon associated with the primary personal finance category. The icon will always be 100×100 pixel PNG file.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            counterparties ([TransactionCounterparty]): The counterparties present in the transaction. Counterparties, such as the merchant or the financial institution, are extracted by Plaid from the raw description.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            merchant_entity_id (str, none_type): A unique, stable, Plaid-generated ID that maps to the merchant. In the case of a merchant with multiple retail locations, this field will map to the broader merchant, not a specific location or store.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

        """Transaction - a model defined in OpenAPI

        Keyword Args:
            account_id (str): The ID of the account in which this transaction occurred.
            amount (float): The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. For all products except Income: Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative. For Income endpoints, values are positive when representing income.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
            category ([str], none_type): A hierarchical array of the categories to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  All Transactions implementations are recommended to use the new `personal_finance_category` instead of `category`, as it provides greater accuracy and more meaningful categorization.  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            category_id (str, none_type): The ID of the category to which this transaction belongs. For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  All Transactions implementations are recommended to use the new `personal_finance_category` instead of `category`, as it provides greater accuracy and more meaningful categorization.  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            date (date): For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ). To receive information about the date that a posted transaction was initiated, see the `authorized_date` field.
            location (Location):
            name (str): The merchant name or transaction description.   Note: This is a legacy field that is not actively maintained. Use `merchant_name` instead for the merchant name.  If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will always appear. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
            payment_meta (PaymentMeta):
            pending (bool): When `true`, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
            pending_transaction_id (str, none_type): The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
            account_owner (str, none_type): The name of the account owner. This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts.
            transaction_id (str): The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.
            authorized_date (date, none_type): The date that the transaction was authorized. For posted transactions, the `date` field will indicate the posted date, but `authorized_date` will indicate the day the transaction was authorized by the financial institution. If presenting transactions to the user in a UI, the `authorized_date`, when available, is generally preferable to use over the `date` field for posted transactions, as it will generally represent the date the user actually made the transaction. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ).
            authorized_datetime (datetime, none_type): Date and time when a transaction was authorized in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ). For posted transactions, the `datetime` field will indicate the posted date, but `authorized_datetime` will indicate the day the transaction was authorized by the financial institution. If presenting transactions to the user in a UI, the `authorized_datetime`, when available, is generally preferable to use over the `datetime` field for posted transactions, as it will generally represent the date the user actually made the transaction.  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00). This field is only populated in API version 2019-05-29 and later.
            datetime (datetime, none_type): Date and time when a transaction was posted in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` ). For the date that the transaction was initiated, rather than posted, see the `authorized_datetime` field.  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00). This field is only populated in API version 2019-05-29 and later.
            payment_channel (str): The channel used to make a payment. `online:` transactions that took place online.  `in store:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `other:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  This field replaces the `transaction_type` field. 
            transaction_code (TransactionCode):
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
                                _visited_composed_classes = (Animal,)
            check_number (str, none_type): The check number of the transaction. This field is only populated for check transactions.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            merchant_name (str, none_type): The merchant name, as enriched by Plaid from the `name` field. This is typically a more human-readable version of the merchant counterparty in the transaction. For some bank transactions (such as checks or account transfers) where there is no meaningful merchant name, this value will be `null`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            original_description (str, none_type): The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/sync` or `/transactions/get`, this field will be omitted unless the client has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            transaction_type (str): Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types. . [optional]  # noqa: E501
            logo_url (str, none_type): The URL of a logo associated with this transaction, if available. The logo will always be 100×100 pixel PNG file.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            website (str, none_type): The website associated with this transaction, if available.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            personal_finance_category (PersonalFinanceCategory): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            personal_finance_category_icon_url (str): The URL of an icon associated with the primary personal finance category. The icon will always be 100×100 pixel PNG file.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            counterparties ([TransactionCounterparty]): The counterparties present in the transaction. Counterparties, such as the merchant or the financial institution, are extracted by Plaid from the raw description.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            merchant_entity_id (str, none_type): A unique, stable, Plaid-generated ID that maps to the merchant. In the case of a merchant with multiple retail locations, this field will map to the broader merchant, not a specific location or store.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
