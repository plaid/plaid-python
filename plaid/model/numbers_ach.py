        """NumbersACH - a model defined in OpenAPI

        Args:
            account_id (str): The Plaid account ID associated with the account numbers
            account (str): The ACH account number for the account.  Note that when using OAuth with Chase Bank (`ins_56`), Chase will issue \"tokenized\" routing and account numbers, which are not the user's actual account and routing numbers. These tokenized numbers should work identically to normal account and routing numbers. The digits returned in the `mask` field will continue to reflect the actual account number, rather than the tokenized account number; for this reason, when displaying account numbers to the user to help them identify their account in your UI, always use the `mask` rather than truncating the `account` number. If a user revokes their permissions to your app, the tokenized numbers will continue to work for ACH deposits, but not withdrawals.
            routing (str): The ACH routing number for the account. If the institution is `ins_56`, this may be a tokenized routing number. For more information, see the description of the `account` field.
            wire_routing (str, none_type): The wire transfer routing number for the account, if available

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
