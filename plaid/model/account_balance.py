        """AccountBalance - a model defined in OpenAPI

        Args:
            available (float, none_type): The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.  If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.
            current (float, none_type): The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.  When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.
            limit (float, none_type): For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
                                _visited_composed_classes = (Animal,)
            last_updated_datetime (datetime, none_type): Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.  This field is only used and expected when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One) and the Item contains one or more accounts with a non-depository account type, in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For Capital One depository accounts as well as all other account types on all other institutions, this field is ignored. See [account type schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type-schema) for a full list of account types.  If the balance that is pulled is older than the given timestamp for Items with this field required, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response..
