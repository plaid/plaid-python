        """AssetReportTransaction - a model defined in OpenAPI

        Args:
            original_description (str, none_type): The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by `/transactions/get`, this field is in beta and will be omitted unless the client is both enrolled in the closed beta program and has set `options.include_original_description` to `true`.
            account_id (str): The ID of the account in which this transaction occurred.
            amount (float): The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency, as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, debit card purchases are positive; credit card payments, direct deposits, and refunds are negative.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
            date (date): For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format ( `YYYY-MM-DD` ).
            pending (bool): When `true`, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled.
            transaction_id (str): The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            transaction_type (str): Please use the `payment_channel` field, `transaction_type` will be deprecated in the future.  `digital:` transactions that took place online.  `place:` transactions that were made at a physical location.  `special:` transactions that relate to banks, e.g. fees or deposits.  `unresolved:` transactions that do not fit into the other three types. .

For a full list of categories, see [`/categories/get`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#categoriesget).  If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights..
