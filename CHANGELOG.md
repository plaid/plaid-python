## 8.0.0-beta
This version represents a transition in how we maintain our external client libraries. We are now using an API spec written in `OpenAPI 3.0.0` and are running our definition file through [OpenAPITool's `python` generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

As part of this transition, we have created a wrapper around existing APIs to ease the burden of migrating to the new API client. The completely unwrapped version will be available next year as we have a few internal changes left to fully support it.

The `OpenAPI` file will be actively maintained and published (coming soon) whenever changes are made to any of our external HTTP API surfaces.  This client library is now pinned to Python `3.7.x` with tests running on Python `3.7.8`.

- Added the `BankTransfer` product.
  - This also adds the endpoint `Sandbox.bank_transfer.simulate`.
- Exposed optional parameters for multiple endpoints:
  - `Holdings.get`
  - `Institutions.get`
  - `Institutions.get_by_id`
  - `Institutions.search`
  - `Item.import_item`
  - `PaymentInitiation.list_payments`
- Added new optional parameter `schedule` to `PaymentInitiation.create_payment`
- Added new `Processor` endpoints:
  - `auth_get`, `balance_get`, `identity_get`

BREAKING CHANGES:

- Removed the `CreditDetails` and `Income` products.
- Removed ability to specify `api_version`, `timeout`, and `suppress_warnings`.
  - The API Version is pinned as of `7.0.0`, so `api_version` shouldn't be here anymore
  - `timeout` and `suppress_warnings` aren't parameters that are configurable in the output generated code.  For things that could be configured once the generated code is unwrapped, check out `generated_plaid.Configuration`.
- Made `products` non-optional for `Institutions.search`.
- Renamed all `Processor` endpoints from `camelCase` to `snake_case`.

Other Deprecations:

- Removed all in-code documentation.  Refer to our new [docs](https://plaid.com/docs), which are generated from the same OpenAPI schema!
