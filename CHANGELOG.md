## 8.0.0b7
This version represents a transition in how we maintain our external client libraries. We are now using an [API spec](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-openapi) written in `OpenAPI 3.0.0` and running our definition file through [OpenAPITool's `python` generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

**Python Migration Guide:**

### Client initialization
From:
```python
from plaid import Client
Client(
    client_id=os.environ['CLIENT_ID'],
    secret=os.environ['SECRET'],
    environment='sandbox',
    api_version="2020-09-14",
    client_app="plaid-python-unit-tests"
)
```

To:
```python
import plaid
from plaid.api import plaid_api
configuration = plaid.Configuration(
    host=plaid.Environment.Sandbox,
    api_key={
        'clientId': client_id,
        'secret': secret,
        'plaidVersion': '2020-09-14'
    }
)
api_client = plaid.ApiClient(configuration)
client = plaid_api.PlaidApi(api_client)
```

### Endpoints
All endpoint requests now take a request model and the functions have been renamed to include `_`.

From:
```python
response = client.Auth.get(access_token)
```

To:
```python
import plaid
from plaid.model.auth_get_request import AuthGetRequest
from plaid.model.auth_get_request_options import AuthGetRequestOptions

ag_request = AuthGetRequest(
    access_token=access_token
)

response = client.auth_get(ag_request)
```

### Errors

From:
```python
try:
    client.Auth.get(access_token)
except ItemError as e:
    if e.code == 'ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED':
    else:
        ...
except APIError as e:
    if e.code == 'PLANNED_MAINTENANCE':
        # inform user
    else:
        ...
```

To:
```python
try:
    request = AssetReportGetRequest(
        asset_report_token=asset_report_token,
    )
    return client.asset_report_get(request)
except plaid.ApiException as e:
    response = json.loads(e.body)
    if response['error_code'] == 'ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED':
    else:
```
